## Description

My second entry to the [Ludumdare](http://www.ludumdare.com/) competition. The theme was **'Chain Reaction'**.

This is from **December, 2007**. I had a lot of fun making this one.

## Original entry notes

```
Description
===========

Move your chainy thing around in such a way that you can bash the ball around with your spikey tail. Bash it into the opponents goal and you get a point.

First to three wins a match!

There is no single-player component in the compo-version, so find a buddy! (alternatively you could just control both players yourself; however, there is a high chance of frying your brain while doing this)

Controls
========

Keyboard:
 Player 1: 
  * WSAD 
 Player 2: 
  * Arrowkeys

Gamepad (xbox360):
 * Left thumbstick

Mouse:
 * Hold left button to maneuver
```
